## Project II: Investigate-a-Dataset

### Introduction
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.

#### Step One - Choose Your Data Set

You <strong>must</strong> choose one of these datasets to complete the project.

#### Step Two - Get Organized

Eventually youâ€™ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Get organized before you begin. We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>report</strong> communicating your findings</li>
    <li>Any <strong>Python code</strong> you wrote as part of your analysis</li>
    <li>The <strong>data set</strong> you used (which you will not need to submit)</li>
</ul>
You may wish to use a Jupyter notebook, in which case you can submit both the code you wrote and the report of your findings in the same document. Otherwise, you will need to submit your report and code separately. If you would like a <strong>notebook template</strong> to help organize your investigation, you can click [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/April/5ac7a08a_investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb/investigate-a-dataset-template.ipynb.zip) . Or there may be a page in the project here called Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project, where you can do all your work and submit the project.
